# ANIMEMAXXING — Product Requirements Document

## 🎯 Concept

**ANIMEMAXXING** is a meme coin website that fuses two massive internet trends: **anime culture** and **looksmaxxing**. The concept: your favorite anime characters are on their own looksmaxxing journey — glow-ups, transformations, and ascension moments — and **$ANIMEMAXX** is the token of that movement.

> *"Stop coping. Start maxxing. Become the main character."*
