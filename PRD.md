# PRD — ANIMEMAXXING Site Improvements (Phase 2)

## 1. Goal Description
The objective is to transform the ANIMEMAXXING landing page from a high-quality static site into a premium, interactive "Main Character" experience. This includes critical UX fixes (mobile navigation), engagement boosters (meme gallery), and elite visual treatments (custom cursor, cinematic grain) to ensure a 10/10 first impression for new users and potential investors on Solana.

## 2. High Impact Features (UX & First Impression)

### [NEW] Mobile Hamburger Menu
*   **Problem**: Navigation links are inaccessible or poorly displayed on mobile viewports.
*   **Solution**: Implement a fullscreen or slide-in animated hamburger menu for mobile.
*   **Aesthetic**: Glassmorphism panel with neon outline and staggered link entries.

### [NEW] Custom Cursor Glow Trail
*   **Problem**: Standard cursor feels disconnected from the "High-Tech Anime" theme.
*   **Solution**: A neon cyan glow (with optional particle trail) that follows the cursor.
*   **Interaction**: Glow intensifies on hover of CTAs or interactive cards.

### [NEW] Anime-Style Reveal (Loading Screen)
*   **Problem**: Instant page load lacks the "cinematic impact" of a premium project.
*   **Solution**: A 1.5s masked logo animation or "Metamorphosis" progress bar that reveals the site.

## 3. Viral / Engagement Boosters

### [NEW] Community Meme Gallery
*   **Objective**: Showcase community creativity and drive shareability.
*   **Feature**: A masonry grid section showcasing elite ANIMEMAXXING memes.
*   **Interaction**: Hover zoom and optional "Share to X" button on individual memes.

### [NEW] "The Countdown" Component
*   **Objective**: Create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) for Launch or Major Updates.
*   **Feature**: A stylized neon countdown timer (e.g., "Time until the next ARC begins").

### [UPDATE] Community Link Audit
*   **Action**: Link the social buttons to the actual Telegram community and official X account.
*   **Polish**: Add "Online Now" status indicator to the Telegram card.

## 4. Master Polish (Visual & Motion)

### [NEW] Cinematic Grain & Noise Overlay
*   **Objective**: Achieve the "Premium Shonen" texture (Azuki/Modern Anime style).
*   **Feature**: A subtle animated noise overlay and retro scanline refinement across the entire site.

### [UPDATE] Advanced Parallax Pass
*   **Objective**: Create depth in the hero and background.
*   **Action**: Multi-layered parallax for floating particles and "Shanks" background art.

### [UPDATE] Glassmorphism 2.0
*   **Objective**: Refine card aesthetics.
*   **Action**: Implement multi-stop border gradients and "Dynamic Inner Glow" on hover for all cards.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   **0 Mobile UX Errors**: Full navigation functionality on all screen sizes.
*   **Retainment**: Increased average session duration due to interactive curiosity (cursor/easter eggs).
*   **Shareability**: Users taking screenshots of the "Metamorphosis" reveal or Meme Gallery.
